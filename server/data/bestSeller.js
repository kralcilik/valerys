    description: `  The iconic Le Creuset Dutch oven is indispensable in the
      kitchens of home cooks and professional chefs alike. Long
      recognized for its strength and durability, cast iron is
      the prime material for slow-cooking, braising and roasting,
      thanks to its ability to maintain even and consistent heat.
      The enameled Dutch oven needs no seasoning, and it’s
      suitable for both stovetop and oven use. The oval shape is
      particularly suited to longer cuts of meat or poultry.`,
